## Bigram Character-Level Language Model 

This is an implementation of a bigram character-level language model, based on [Andrej Karpathy's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaCmpygFfXo). 
The goal is to build a simple language model that learns character-level probabilities from names and generates new names.
